Live, their deconstructive take on experimental rock and American roots music incorporates enough observations on its misogyny, racism, and topical confusion to part their crowds like Moses. They've picked on the human race by covering both the Brainbombs and Randy Newman's ""Short People"", hell, they've even picked on each other in their songs. Pitchfork even gave one of their records a 3.2 out of 10 despite the fact these guys are heavily influenced by the Fall. This show was aired a few weeks back on Brian's Tuesday afternoon program but this morning we netcast it on the web only free of FCC restrictions. The band: Ben Wallers: Vocal, Guitar, Robert McNeill: Keyboard, 4-track, Guitar, Leighton Crook: Drums, Sophie Politowicz: Bass, Alastair Mackinven: Guitar.

Their self-titled release on the Important label displayed brilliantly how a band can evoke classic 70's rock without succumbing to ironic posturing, combining 12-string, mandolin, organ, and occassional Thin Lizzy-inspired electric leads into a gorgeous, and surprisingly original concoction. The band today: Jesse Reiner - guitar, Warren Huegel - drums, Adria Otte - guitar, Tahlia Harbour - vocals, glockenspiel, percussion, Diego Gonzalez - Bass, Julie Napolin - Keyboards, flute, vocals, guitar, Ezra Feinberg - guitar, vocals.

<p><a href=""http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=24229658"">Harvey Milk</a> are without a doubt one band I am obsessed with, and the funny thing is that most people I meet who are fans of them are also obsessed with them; it seems that there are few casual listeners to their music. Born in Athens, GA in the early 1990's, they issued a slew of records that should have been recognized much more than they were; their non-peggability probably hurt their public/press profile, not to mention the neo-Barrett psychedelia that was emerging from their hometown overshadowing them somewhat in the scheme of collegiate radio. But what amazing records, and thanks to people like <a href=""http://www.chunklet.com/"">Chunklet</a>, <a href=""http://www.relapse.com/""> Relapse</a>, <a href=""http://www.tumult.net/"">tUMULT</a> and others, the microscope once again has turned to them in the last few years and they've come back into action fully. I finally saw them for the first time a few years ago at Tonic opening for Khanate, and it remains one of my favorite live show memories. They sucked the oxygen out of the air for minutes at a time; extended passages of silence give way to crushing, Melvinsy swaths of pure majestic overload; singer/guitarist Creston issued forth gutteral vocals like he was fronting Lynard Skynard slowed down to 16 RPM. Muzzy chords would just loom ominously over the room for what seemed like an eternity and then they'd crack open into propulsive Thin Lizzy mode and change bizarre time signatures on a dime and sounded just fantastic. When asked if they could get on <a href=""http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2008/03/whos-who-at-the.html"">WFMU's SXSW bill</a> for March, I couldn't have been more thrilled. We had a close call getting HM on my show a few years back but some crossed signals confused their show-up time with their club soundcheck; my engineer had by then gone home and I was devastated. But now, having the band show up and kick off the proceedings at Spiro's first on the bill (sorry about the club's drink ticketkeeper being AWOL, Stephen!) was a total freakin' dream come true. With Joe Preston (Melvins/Thrones) on 2nd guitar! What a way to start an evening.</p>",1840,en,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 International,1268,,4,,[],Old Glory,0.8317825641,0.2947630654,0.1749396339,0.0009749937,0.2932208197,0.0409431493,90.344,0.4023866811

While the Alps' junkpile approach to classic rock via wasted echo-chamber vocals and lost-in-space mod guitars might sound like a bad trip to some, there's a real cohesion and weirdly tuneful vibe carried through the scuzz that might make their new LP Description of the Harbor one of your year's faves. More info at www.sicalps.com. The band ees: Mike Donovan - vox, guitar, Matthew Hartman: drums, bass (on last tune). Songs today: Gruxxe Bathe Ballade, Brill Building, Mater, C.O./C.A., A Story Over There, Latin, Stories, Everywhere There, Semi-Streets, I Know Where the Madness Goes.</span></p>

The Nightingales were formed in 1979, put out many ground-breaking records such as Idiot Strength in 1981, and the incredible Pigs on Purpose album in 1982 and many other great records thru the '80s. They then broke up in the mid-'80s and reformed in 2004! But The Nightingales are not a nostalgia act--- yes they play their older material, but they have excellent new material! Equal parts rock-n-roll noise and melody, the Nightingales bring a fresh perspective to now!</span></p>

Their self-titled release on the Important label displayed brilliantly how a band can evoke classic 70's rock without succumbing to ironic posturing, combining 12-string, mandolin, organ, and occassional Thin Lizzy-inspired electric leads into a gorgeous, and surprisingly original concoction. The band today: Jesse Reiner - guitar, Warren Huegel - drums, Adria Otte - guitar, Tahlia Harbour - vocals, glockenspiel, percussion, Diego Gonzalez - Bass, Julie Napolin - Keyboards, flute, vocals, guitar, Ezra Feinberg - guitar, vocals. Thanks to Gil and the band!

When <a href=""http://www.halfjapanese.co.uk/"">Half Japanese</a> took the stage at Spiro's Friday night and blew into the first measures of ""Firecracker"", the whole of the crowd (which included entire bands of disciples like Times New Viking, Yo La Tengo, Psychedelic Horseshit) had smiles stretched ear to ear. And what a set it was. Not only did onlookers at <a href=""http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2008/03/whos-who-at-the.html"">WFMU's first ever showcase/broadcast in Austin </a>get to see both Jad and David Fair onstage again, but they saw them in absolutely astounding mode. For over a half hour the group lurched through total classics: ""Thing With a Hook"", ""Nicole Told Me"", ""I'll Change My Style"" all the way through the burning impromptu finale of the 13th Floor Elevators' ""You're Gonna Miss Me"". What made the set extra special (besides Jad's spastic strumming on his red mini-electric axe and David's full on dance invocations of Timothy Carey ala <em>World's Greatest Sinner</em>) was the presence of a classic era lineup that included Mark Jickling, John Moreman, Rick and John Dreyfuss and extra 2nd sax from guest Ira Kaplan. Pure joy. I will say though, I was bummed a bit afterwards when Ira showed me the setlist and the tunes that got cut due to time constraints, but happy to say I caught a bunch of them the next day at Half Jap's Waterloo Records in-store. More SXSW archives, photos, and video to come, but let's drop a pile of MP3s right off the bat from the Band Who Would Be King (sorry though, we have to cut the Roky cover!). Thanks to WFMU Free Music Archivist Jason for the slice and dice.</p>

The Nightingales were formed in 1979, put out many ground-breaking records such as Idiot Strength in 1981, and the incredible Pigs on Purpose album in 1982 and many other great records thru the '80s. They then broke up in the mid-'80s and reformed in 2004! But The Nightingales are not a nostalgia act--- yes they play their older material, but they have excellent new material! Equal parts rock-n-roll noise and melody, the Nightingales bring a fresh perspective to now!</span></p>

While the Alps' junkpile approach to classic rock via wasted echo-chamber vocals and lost-in-space mod guitars might sound like a bad trip to some, there's a real cohesion and weirdly tuneful vibe carried through the scuzz that might make their new LP Description of the Harbor one of your year's faves. More info at www.sicalps.com. The band ees: Mike Donovan - vox, guitar, Matthew Hartman: drums, bass (on last tune). Songs today: Gruxxe Bathe Ballade, Brill Building, Mater, C.O./C.A., A Story Over There, Latin, Stories, Everywhere There, Semi-Streets, I Know Where the Madness Goes.</span></p>

Their self-titled release on the Important label displayed brilliantly how a band can evoke classic 70's rock without succumbing to ironic posturing, combining 12-string, mandolin, organ, and occassional Thin Lizzy-inspired electric leads into a gorgeous, and surprisingly original concoction. The band today: Jesse Reiner - guitar, Warren Huegel - drums, Adria Otte - guitar, Tahlia Harbour - vocals, glockenspiel, percussion, Diego Gonzalez - Bass, Julie Napolin - Keyboards, flute, vocals, guitar, Ezra Feinberg - guitar, vocals.

While the Alps' junkpile approach to classic rock via wasted echo-chamber vocals and lost-in-space mod guitars might sound like a bad trip to some, there's a real cohesion and weirdly tuneful vibe carried through the scuzz that might make their new LP Description of the Harbor one of your year's faves. More info at www.sicalps.com. The band ees: Mike Donovan - vox, guitar, Matthew Hartman: drums, bass (on last tune). Songs today: Gruxxe Bathe Ballade, Brill Building, Mater, C.O./C.A., A Story Over There, Latin, Stories, Everywhere There, Semi-Streets, I Know Where the Madness Goes.</span></p>
